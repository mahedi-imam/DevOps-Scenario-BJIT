To design an AWS infrastructure solution diagram that meets the provided  requirements. I’ll break down the components and services, and then provide a comprehensive diagram.
1. Backend Components:
•	Two API Servers:
o	These can be implemented using Amazon EC2 instances.
•	Autoscaling for API Servers:
o	We’ll use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
•	RDS (Relational Database Service):
o	For the database, we’ll use Amazon RDS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Aurora).
•	Redis Server:
o	We’ll set up a Redis cluster using Amazon ElastiCache.
•	Lambda Function:
o	We’ll set up a Lambda Function to serve all the API services.
•	API Gateway:
o	To authenticate and authorize the API request we will use an API Gateway.
•	SSL Certificates and Domains:
o	We’ll use Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL certificates.
o	For domains, we can use Amazon Route 53.
2. Frontend Components:
•	Amazon CloudFront:
o	We’ll implement CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) for the frontend.
o	CloudFront will cache static assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) and distribute them globally.
•	Access Restriction:
o	To restrict access to the frontend:
	We can use Amazon CloudFront signed URLs or cookies.
	Configure Origin Access Identity (OAI) to allow only CloudFront to access the S3 bucket (where frontend assets are stored).


3. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):
•	We’ll set up CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild & AWS CodeDeploy
o	Source: AWS CodePipeline connect to your code repository (GitHub).
o	Build: Use AWS CodeBuild to build and package your application.
o	Deploy: AWS CodeDeploy to the appropriate environment 
o	S3 bucket to store the Code and fronted assets
4. Networking Components:
•	Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
o	We will create a custom VPC with public and private subnets.
o	Use Network ACLs (NACLs) and Security Groups for network security.
•	Subnet Configuration:
o	Public Subnets: For API servers, RDS, and ElastiCache.
o	Private Subnets: For backend instances (EC2).
•	Route Tables:
o	Route traffic between subnets using route tables.
•	Internet Gateway (IGW):
o	Attach to the VPC for public internet access.
•	NAT Gateway:
o	In public subnets, route outbound traffic from private subnets to the internet.
